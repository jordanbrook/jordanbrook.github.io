I'm a research scientist specialising in severe weather, data assimilation, and advanced radar analysis. I'm currently a Research Scientist at the Bureau of Meteorology and an Adjunct Research Fellow at the University of Queensland. 

I bring a strong computational and physical sciences background to my work, combined with practical experience in private industry, in the field, and in our operational weather service.

I hold a Ph.D. in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Queensland, where my dissertation on hailstorms and weather radars won the Deanâ€™s Award for Outstanding Thesis. Nowadays, I'm focused on assimilating radar data into convection-allowing models to improve forecasts of severe weather.
